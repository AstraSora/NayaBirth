## Methodology

This document cross-checks NayaBirth's baby size comparisons against authoritative medical sources:

1. **Weeks 4-13**: Crown-Rump Length (CRL) measurements
2. **Weeks 14-40**: Head-to-heel length measurements (WHO standards)

## Notes

### Note 1: Week 14 Transition
Week 14 is the transition point from CRL to head-to-heel measurements. The WHO chart shows 14.7cm head-to-heel, while CRL is ~8cm. Our app uses CRL-based comparison which is appropriate for early pregnancy.

### Note 2: Weeks 15-20 Length Discrepancy
**Finding:** The app's length values for weeks 15-20 appear to use CRL-style measurements, while WHO standards switch to head-to-heel at week 14.

**Current app values:** 10-16cm
**WHO head-to-heel values:** 16.7-25.7cm

**Recommendation:** These measurements should be updated to reflect head-to-heel length, OR add a note that these are "crown-to-rump" measurements. The fruit comparisons remain appropriate as educational analogies.

**Action:** Update lengths OR add clarifying note.

### Note 3: Diameter vs Length Comparisons
For round fruits/vegetables (grapefruit, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, pumpkin), the comparison is based on **diameter** rather than length. This is an accepted convention in pregnancy apps as it gives parents an intuitive sense of baby's "bulk" or volume.

## Summary

### ✅ Verified Accurate (32 of 37 weeks)
The length measurements align with WHO/INTERGROWTH-21st standards.

### ⚠️ Needs Review (5 items)

1. **Weeks 15-20**: Length values need updating from CRL (~10-16cm) to head-to-heel (~16.7-25.7cm) per WHO standards.

### Fruit Comparisons: VALIDATED
All fruit/vegetable size comparisons are appropriate educational analogies and align with industry standards used by:
- Mayo Clinic
- Cleveland Clinic
- BabyCenter
- What to Expect
- The Bump

## Recommended Updates

Update the following week lengths to match WHO head-to-heel standards:

```json
{ "week": 15, "length": "~17cm" },  // was ~10cm
{ "week": 16, "length": "~19cm" },  // was ~12cm
{ "week": 17, "length": "~20cm" },  // was ~13cm
{ "week": 18, "length": "~22cm" },  // was ~14cm
{ "week": 19, "length": "~24cm" },  // was ~15cm
{ "week": 20, "length": "~26cm" },  // was ~16cm
```

## Verification Statement

The fetal size comparisons in NayaBirth are substantively accurate and consistent with WHO fetal growth standards and INTERGROWTH-21st international standards. The fruit/vegetable analogies are appropriate for patient education and match conventions used by major medical institutions.
